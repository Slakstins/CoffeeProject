# CoffeeProject

This system works by reading a Order json file to produce the results that a hypothetical
full fledged coffee production system would produce. To test an order, run main.
You should receive instructions on the valid order numbers to test.
The output for orders 1-3 should use an advanced coffee machine, and order 4
should use a simple machine. Order 5 utilizes the Programmable coffee machine recipes.
 Included are some test cases to ensure the function
of the Factory, Decorator, and Strategy patterns that were implemented in this design.
